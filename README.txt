# Assignment-3

We did not change thw files from the textbook except the cpp file containing the main function (named Assignment_3.cpp).
We added indeed some functions and output to make a tester of our 2 new classes.
We created as asked two new classes named PieceWorker (with PieceWorker.h and PieceWorker.cpp files) and HourlyWorker (with HourlyWorker.h and HourlyWorker.cpp files).

We changed the main file and added two other employees so that our classes may be tested.
In this program there is no need for the user to input informations.
